Key Components:

Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Remove irrelevant features such as special characters and stopwords from the complaint narratives. Tokenization: Convert the text data into tokens for better processing by NLP models.

Model Development
Train a text classification model using: Traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest). Transformer-based deep learning models (e.g., BERT). Experiment with different architectures to identify the best-performing model for this classification task.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using the following metrics: Accuracy Precision Recall F1-Score Fine-tune the model to improve classification accuracy and overall performance.

Routing Mechanism Implement an automated routing system that uses the model outputs to assign complaints to the appropriate financial departments.

Feedback Loop

Develop a feedback mechanism for resolution teams to provide feedback on the modelâ€™s accuracy and routing decisions. Use this feedback to optimize the model further and improve routing efficiency.

Expected Outcomes:

A trained and fine-tuned NLP classification model capable of accurately categorizing complaints into the predefined product categories.

Project Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for model training by cleaning and tokenizing the text narratives.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Experiment with traditional machine learning and transformer-based models. Fine-tune the best-performing model using evaluation metrics.
